# Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau

### About Citi Bike:
New York City's [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/homepage) is the nation's largest bike share program. The program has two options of an annual membership or short-term passes that give riders access to more than 20,000 bikes and 1,300 stations throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City.

### Assignment Details:
The program has collected data since 2013 on a monthly basis for each ride and compiled the information into csv files. The data is freely available to the public on Citi Bike's [website](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). In this assignment, the task was to complete an analysis of the data over any given timeframe to find trends.

The [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kirsten.larson/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis_16668173964600/NYCSpringStory) that I created focused on the spring seasons (March 20th-June 21st) in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. In addition to finding trends for the season overall, I focused on two nationally recognized days over the four years -- Earth Day (April 22nd) and National Bike to Work Day (third Friday of every May) to see if ridership on these particular days went up compared to the rest of the season.
