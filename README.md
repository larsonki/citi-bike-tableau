# Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau

### About Citi Bike:
New York City's [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/homepage) is the nation's largest bike share program. The program has two options of an annual membership or short-term passes that give riders access to more than 20,000 bikes and 1,300 stations throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City.

### Assignment Details:
The program has collected data since 2013 on a monthly basis for each ride and compiled the information into csv files. The data is freely available to the public on Citi Bike's [website](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). In this assignment, the task was to complete an analysis of the data over any given timeframe to find trends.

The [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kirsten.larson/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis_16668173964600/NYCSpringStory) that I created focused on the spring seasons (March 20th-June 21st) in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. In addition to finding trends for the season overall, I focused on two nationally recognized days over the four years -- Earth Day (April 22nd) and National Bike to Work Day (third Friday of every May) to see if ridership on these particular days went up compared to the rest of the season.

### Analysis Summary
***How does ridership for these two specific days compare to the rest of spring?***

Comparing the daily average of the number of rides (5,319) across all four years, Earth Day falls short in all but one year (2022).

On the other hand, for National Bike to Work Day the number of rides exceeds the daily average for all but one year (2022). However, one would expect in reviewing the hourly information that there would be peaks in the ridership during the commuter hours for each day. While 2019 has pronounced peaks during commuter hours, the other years have either softer peaks or show more rides during the evening hours.

June typically has the highest number of rides year after year. Multiple factors could contribute to this such as weather, end of the school year and early summer vacations.

***Does the number of non-subscriber Citi Bike users increase on these two specific days compared to the rest of spring?***

Comparing the daily average of the number of rides for non-subscribers (1,275) across all four years, Earth Day falls short in all but one year (2022).

Taking into consideration that Bike to Work Day is meant to encourage people who would not otherwise bike to work, one would expect non-subscribers to increase during commuting hours. In 2020 and 2021, non-subscriber ridership increased well above the hourly average, but the times of day where they increased were primarily in the afternoon and evening. In 2019 and 2022, the number of rides by non-subscribers did not exceed the daily average.

***Station Map Analysis***

Manhatten has the highest number of stations compared to all other boroughs. The Bronx and Staten Island do not appear to include any stations, while Queens and Brooklyn have them in the areas closest to Manhatten.

On Manhatten, most of the stations are clustered south of Central Park.

The number of rides decreased, as expected significantly during the stay-at-home order at the beginning of the pandemic. March and April of 2020 show the lowest number of rides each day.
